/*
 You are given 3 threads. You need to print sequence using these 3 threads.You need to print in natural order up to MAX.

For example:
Letï¿½s say you have 3 threads. T1,T2 and T3.
If MAX is 10, you need to print:
T1 1
T2 2
T3 3
T1 4
T2 5
T3 6
T1 7
T2 8
T3 9
T1 10

Solution: We will use concept of remainder here.

    If number%3==1 then T1 will print the number and increment it else will go in the wait state.
    If number%3==2 then T2 will print the number and increment it else will go in the wait state.
    If number%3==0 then T3 will print the number and increment it else will go in the wait state.
